# Game-with-python
An adventure game using the python library pygame

## Game
This is how the game looks now,still need to work on the art and the code
![Alt text](Game/game1.png?raw=true "lvl1")

For now, i have added all the animation of the player(idle, jump, attacks, hurt, die), but the art still need some work since it looks that they don't have all the same size.
There are 2 enemys add to the first level:
the first enemy follow the player when the vision rect collides with the player rect, and the player get damages when it collides with the enemy rect
the second attacks when he sees the player

## Level Editor
I have added a level editor that uses csv files to save and lead level:

![Alt text](LevelEditor/lvleditor.png?raw=true "lvleditor")


The art used in this game was all done by me.
I will be sharing the code when it's finished
Keep in mind this is my first game made ever, the code won't be perfect.

I used mostly the code from this [tutorial](https://github.com/russs123/Shooter)
