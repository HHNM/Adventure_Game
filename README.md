## Special Thanks 

[Ahmed Albastaki](https://youtube.com/@AhmedAlbastaki) channel, specialy [the Extreme Game Dev](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfre3pZQr_QmlafR0AG7EikdD2JV8KJI8) playlist helped with understanding the basics of game development and animation. 

The main characters and the idea of the game are inspired from the people behind that channel.  


The playlist from the [Coding With Russ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjcN1EyupaQm20hlUE11y9y8EY2aXLpnv) youtube channel was a great guide to help me start coding the game with python
