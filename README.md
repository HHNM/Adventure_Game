# Game-with-python
An adventure game using the python library pygame.

## Game

This is how the game looks now,still need to work on the art and the code
![Alt text](Github_Images/game1.png?raw=true "lvl1")

For now, i have added all the animation of the player(idle, jump, attacks, hurt, die), but the art still need some work since it looks that they don't have all the same size.

There are 2 enemys added to the first level:

The first enemy follows the player when the vision rect collides with the player's rect, and the player get damages when its rect collides with the enemy's rect.

The second attacks when he sees the player.

## Level Editor

I have added a level editor that uses csv files to save and lead level:

The art used in this game was all done by me(the player is not my original character).

I will be sharing the code when it's finished.

Keep in mind this is my first game made ever, the code won't be perfect.

I used mostly the code from this [tutorial](https://github.com/russs123/Shooter)
